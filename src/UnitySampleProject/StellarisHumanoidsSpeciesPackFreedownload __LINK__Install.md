The pack adds 10 new portraits for humanoid species, such as elves, dwarves, orcs, and more. It also adds a new ship class called the "Nexus", which is inspired by sci-fi classics. The pack also includes three new voiceover sets for the game's AI assistant VIR, and three new music tracks composed by Andreas Waldetoft.
 
One of the most interesting features of the pack is the new civics that are exclusive to humanoid species. These are:

- Byzantine Bureaucracy: A highly centralized and hierarchical society that benefits from reduced sprawl and increased administrative capacity.
- Feudal Society: A decentralized and feudal society that allows vassals to expand beyond their borders and grants bonuses to feudal contracts.
- Philosopher King: A enlightened monarchy that has a ruler with increased level cap and skill gain.
- Life-Seeded: A society that originated on a Gaia world and prefers to live in harmony with nature. They have increased habitability on Gaia worlds but reduced habitability on other types of worlds.
- Post-Apocalyptic: A society that survived a nuclear war and has adapted to living on a tomb world. They have increased habitability on tomb worlds and can colonize them without penalties.
- Citizen Service: A militaristic society that requires citizens to serve in the military for a period of time. They have increased naval capacity and happiness from soldiers.

These civics can add new challenges and opportunities to your gameplay, depending on your playstyle and goals. You can also combine them with other civics and traits to create unique and diverse empires.
