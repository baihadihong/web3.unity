You will receive a USB-dongle with the software installed on it. You do not need to install anything on your computer, as ECM Titanium can run directly from the USB-dongle. You can use ECM Titanium on any computer at hand.
 
Once you plug in the USB-dongle, you can launch ECM Titanium from the desktop icon or from the start menu. You will need to activate your subscription with your email and password. You will also need to update your software and drivers regularly to get access to the latest features and files.
 
## How to Use ECM Titanium Full Version
 
To use ECM Titanium full version, you need to read the file stored in the memory of the ECU using a compatible device, such as KESSv2 or K-TAG. You can then upload the file to ECM Titanium and start working on it.
 
ECM Titanium will automatically search for compatible drivers in your database and online databank. Drivers are software modules that transform the file parameters into a structure easy to comprehend. You can choose from different categories of parameters, such as injection, advance, torque, turbo pressure, limiters, etc.
 
You can edit the file parameters in three different ways: tabular view, 3D view, or hexadecimal view. Tabular view shows the data in a table format with rows and columns. 3D view shows the data in a graphical format with curves and surfaces. Hexadecimal view shows the data in a raw format with hexadecimal codes.
