Need for Speed: Underground 2 is a classic racing game that was released in 2004 by Electronic Arts. It is the eighth installment in the Need for Speed series and one of the most popular ones. The game features a variety of modes, cars, tracks, and customization options that let you tune your car to your liking. However, one of the drawbacks of the game is that it does not support widescreen resolutions natively. This means that if you have a monitor with a 16:9 or 16:10 aspect ratio, you will see black bars on the sides of the screen or a stretched image that distorts the graphics.

Luckily, there is a solution to this problem. You can use a widescreen patch that modifies the game files to enable widescreen support. This patch will allow you to play the game in any resolution you want, including 1366x768, which is a common resolution for laptops and some monitors. The patch also fixes some bugs and adds some features to the game, such as improved HUD scaling, FOV adjustment, windowed mode, and more.

## Benefits of Playing in Widescreen Resolution
 
Playing Need for Speed: Underground 2 in widescreen resolution has several advantages over playing in the default 4:3 resolution. Here are some of them:

- You will have a wider field of view, which means you will see more of the road and the surroundings. This can help you to spot obstacles, shortcuts, and opponents more easily.
- You will have a more immersive and realistic experience, as the game will match the shape of your monitor and fill the entire screen. You will feel like you are actually driving the car and not watching it on a TV.
- You will have better graphics quality, as the game will use more pixels to render the image. The textures, shadows, and lighting will look sharper and smoother.

## Troubleshooting Tips for the Widescreen Patch
 
While the widescreen patch for Need for Speed: Underground 2 is generally easy to use and works well, you may encounter some issues or errors while using it. Here are some tips to solve them:

- If the game crashes or does not launch after applying the patch, make sure you have the latest version of the game (v1.2) and that you have installed the patch correctly. You may also need to run the game as administrator or in compatibility mode for Windows XP.
- If the game runs too fast or too slow after applying the patch, you may need to adjust the FPS limit in the nfsu2.widescreenfix.ini file. The default value is 60, but you can change it to any number that suits your system and preference.
- If the game looks stretched or distorted after applying the patch, you may need to adjust the aspect ratio in the nfsu2.widescreenfix.ini file. The default value is 0, which means it will use your monitor's aspect ratio. However, if your monitor has a different aspect ratio than your resolution, you may need to change it to 1 (for 16:9) or 2 (for 16:10).
